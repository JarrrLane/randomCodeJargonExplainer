JSX: Extension for javascript xml, used with things like React for the UI

NPM: Node package manager, default package manager for Node.js

Package Manager: Think of it like an app store for JavaScript. Developers create and publish reusable code (called "packages" or "modules") to the npm registry. NPM then allows you to easily install, manage, and share this code in your own projects.

API: the middleman, the thing that talks to both the user and the backend server

API key: a little token that lets you actually talk to the middle man

pipeline: a fancy way of saying that something goes through a ton of steps to get done

integration: make two things work together seamlessly

JWT Json web token: Like a cookie, but it is signed and stored in the browser instead of in the server, so in future requests, the server tooks at the token, checks the signature, thinks "the signature is valid so this definitely came from us and wasn't tampered", and all is good

GraphQL: A language for talking to APIs and only getting data that is needed
